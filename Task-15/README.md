I'm a beginner at coding and come from a non computer science background.In class python was being taught, along with which I attempted problems from online coding platforms because I became very interested in problem solving and then coding my idea.When solving a problem, I first think of a logic and try to build on it in the form of a python code and in the process I also learnt new python concepts that I could apply for that particular problem through google and some python tutorial videos on youtube.Many times errors come when I try to run my code, mainly runtime errors and terminated due to timeout, after which I researched about some more python concepts to run the code more effectively and modified my code many times to test it out.
