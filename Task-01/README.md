# Terminal Wizard
First I installed git and then went through a few git commands before starting. After installing gh, I cloned the repository and created a directory. I found out the values of x and y in the first challenge and found the spellname and the spell. Then I googled how to execute a python file in terminal, followed the instructions and found the secret code.
