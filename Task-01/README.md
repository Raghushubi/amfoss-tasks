# Terminal Wizard
First I installed git and then went through a few git commands before starting. After installing gh, I cloned the repository and created a directory. I found out the values of x and y in the first challenge and found the spellname and the spell. Then I googled how to execute a python file in terminal, followed the instructions and found the secret code. 
I repeated the same process for the other challenges as well and after getting all the 4 codes i concatenated them into one single code and stored it in [finalcode.txt](https://github.com/Raghushubi/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/Task-01/finalcode.txt).Then I decoded the final code and got a link which instructed me to run a python file in terminal and upload the [screenshot](https://github.com/Raghushubi/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/Task-01/TheOneThatEndsItAll.png) and create a [SOLUTION.md](https://github.com/Raghushubi/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/Task-01/SOLUTION.md) which contained all the commands that I used to accomplish this task.
